# Python with SQLAlchemy and PyMongo

This repository contains sample code for using Python with two popular databases: SQLAlchemy and PyMongo. The code is contained in two files: `project.py` and `mongodb_project.py`.

## Project.py

`project.py` is a Python script that demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, to interact with a SQL database. The script connects to a local SQLite database and performs various operations, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.

To run `project.py`, you need to have SQLAlchemy installed on your machine. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install sqlalchemy
```

Once you have installed SQLAlchemy, you can run the script using the following command:

```
python project.py
```

## Mongodb_project.py

`mongodb_project.py` is a Python script that demonstrates how to use PyMongo, a Python driver for MongoDB, to interact with a MongoDB database. The script connects to a local MongoDB database and performs various operations, such as inserting data, querying data, and updating data.

To run `mongodb_project.py`, you need to have PyMongo installed on your machine. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install pymongo
```

Once you have installed PyMongo, you can run the script using the following command:

```
python mongodb_project.py
```

That's it! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
